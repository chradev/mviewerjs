Implementations of APOS theory in classrooms typically use the ACE (Activities, Classroom discussion and Exercise) Teaching Cycle, a pedagogical strategy with three chronological components: activities, classroom discussion, and exercises. Implementations also often use mathematical programming languages, most commonly ISETL.

### APOS theory was developed by Ed Dubinsky and others and is based on Jean Piaget's notion of reflective abstraction.

### What and where is S.T.E.A.M.?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_education" target="_blank">S.T.E.A.M.</a> is the nowadays contemporary educational paradigm for <strong style="font-size: 1.2em;"><em>"Learn by Doing"</em></strong>. 

- It uses some of the APOS theory ideas and ACE Teaching Cycle practices. 
- It is based on Mathematics, Computer Sciences and interactive sequential programming languages. 
- Furthermore, it also exploits nowadays engineering, technology and art achievements.

### Some missing but important aspects

The sequential procedures, objects and other basic aspects of the classic teaching processes are very important but not enough. 

- **The parallelism** is everywhere around us. 
- **The association** is everywhere inside us.
- **The motivation** is the force moving everything.
