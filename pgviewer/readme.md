It is computed an equilateral polygon inscribed in a circle with R = 1 (D = 2).<br>
Calculated polygon is drawn on SVG using HTML, JS, d3, React DOM, etc. <br>
In animation, the number of points is like counting forward and backward:<br>
2 (line), 3 (triangle), 4 (quadrilateral), ..., polygon with N sides / vertices<br>
In addition to the simple variant, the sides are replaced with Koch fractal curves.<br>
