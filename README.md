#  mViewerJS 
This is a project for a web multi-viewer written entirely in HTML and JavaScript. There are some more staff included in the current project. There are also some 3-rd party libraries with separate licensing. Some of the materials included are intended for children, and others are the result of my many years of work as a professional in the fields of physics, engineering, computer sciences and information technologies.

The main features of the mViewerJS is to help in the visualization of files like MD, PDF, MIDI, etc. The visualization is supported by a single file,  mviewerjs.html and includes:
- Markdown viewer
- PDF flip book viewer based on dFlip and ViewerJS libraries
- MP3 and MIDI support for PDF flip book visualization based on dFlip
- Visualization while playing MP3 and MIDI files
- [A poligon and Kock fractal viewer](,/pgviewer)
